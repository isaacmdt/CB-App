2 minutes. Two minutes is all is needed to commit to get started on your CreativeBox. 

When I get myself to show up for two minutes. Most of the time I get into the grove and stick around. It's that commitment to showing up that can turn 2 minutes in to a craving for more. That first few steps turns in to a groove, keep going. 

Am addicted reading ways to get things done better. I've read countless books on time management, project management, habit changing, self-improving, 21 days to a new you books and article. One idea from some of these systems is the 2 minute rule from James Clears' Atomic Habits. (Which I think he got from David Alan Getting Things Done.)

> Two-Minute Rule, which states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” [1]

*"Sketch everyday" becomes "open my sketchbook and sharpen my pencil"*

*"Film a video" becomes "Record a thirty second clip"*

*"Write a blog" becomes "Open blank document and write one crapy draft sentence"*

Whatever your CreativeBox is boil it down to it's simplest form. Small steps in the direction you want to go. Is better than taking every step going nowhere. Whether you like it or not you are always moving forward but that doesn't mean you are going where you want or should be going.

So take that first step, and show up. Even if it's only for two minutes.
