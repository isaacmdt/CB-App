It's a new year. Time for new things. Bleh I hate doing new things. Normal is cosy. Familiar is easy. There is comfort in doing things you know. One of my personal struggles is wanting to tackling new projects I know are winnable, doable, within my reach.

Why in the world did I think about starting CreativeBox? A new project, with complete unknowns. With no way of knowing if I could win. Will I give up a few steps in? What you have to know about me is this isn't the first time I have started a blog or started a new project. Twitch Creative 2016. Daily UI Challenge 2017. Blog bi-weekly , Read 20 books in one year â€“ 2018. Twitch Lasted two weeks. Six days into daily UI. Several posts for blogging, and 9.6 for books. In other words I stink at keeping new things going. 

Getting in a few steps before bailing. Having thoughts that make me crumble, "I can't do it" or "It's too much effort".

CreativeBox is another of my personal passion project experiment. This time I have set expectation to allow for this project to fail. I want to be able to change things. Iterate. To play the infinite game. Play as long as possible. With a goal to push myself as a creative to be better than I was yesterday. This idea to push further is were the idea for the Creative Box was born. 

Gym nuts don't skip out when it's leg day, because its hard. You don't get to say no to a client or boss when they present you with a project that looks a little to hard. At least I don't get that privilege if you do teach me your ways. 

It wasn't until I started drawing lunch napkins for my son in preschool. Where the letter or subject of the week became my theme. Three days out of the week. One napkin doodle on the letter J or plants. Boundaries, Yes! A napkin canvas, a broad theme, pens and markers as my medium, and a deadline for to be done before we walked out the door to school. 

Creatives like boundaries. We work better in boxes. Whether it's a subject matter or the medium, paint, film, or haikus. We like to be confined, not strapped down with our eyes taped open. Confined in broad enough area to still be creative but with enough rules that we know where the edges are. When we know what the box looks like we are have some confidents that we might nail it or at least be content with the outcome.
 
When I was doing daily doodles as one of my new things, and before Miss Jonson (My sons teacher.) gave me the weekly themes. I was using online random word generators. Bleh. What I found was that either I didn't think the word was workable or would skip it all together. I didn't do it.

Ah the CreativeBox was born. An app that gave one word. The one piece of the creative box that I didn't have. Semi-curated theme to do whatever I wanted with. 

One word to make my own. To figure out for myself what is possible with each creative box thrown at me. Coming back every day, doing something new. But starting something new is hard. The hardest step is showing up. 

Would join me on this journey? Come up with your own canvas, medium, and deadline. I'll provide themes every day.Together we can learn how to push the edges of our creative boxes and be better then were were yesterday, 1% at a time.
