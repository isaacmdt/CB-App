Let's be honest. I hate working in the box. It's stuffy and feels so limiting. Or so I thought. The other day my 3-year-old showed me how wrong I was.

He was playing with an empty cardboard box that was lying around. He would push it around. Climb in it. Close himself up and then pop out like a jack-in-the-box.

Until he popped out with so much energy the box came apart at the seams.

Game over! At least that what I thought.

He was sad for a moment as he looked at the box laid out flat on the ground. Then he grabbed one of the sides folding it back over on itself to make a triangle tent. Yelling in excitement "Look Pop my house! My house!"

He continued to play with his new house. He was happy.

It got me thinking. Where am I so focused on the was seems broken. Am I limiting things and situation to what it looks like? Do I see the unseen potential that's hidden if I only looked for it?

Maybe... just maybe... I need to be willing to break the box. Find something new hidden by what looks like the only way. Change my perspective to what is to what it can be. With a little bit of imagination and ingenuity. I could see the box become a house.
