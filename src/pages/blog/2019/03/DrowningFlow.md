When you are a "Go with the Flow" kind of person like me. The flaw to that kind of thinking comes when the flow becomes a swift raging rapid. You get swept away pretty far off with no sense of direction and feel like you are gasping for air.

I had planned to do a blog every week for this project. But because of some crazy life situations with my family. A new born, round robin with some colds and then some hospital time when my new little caught one of those colds. I had to put everything that wasn't a high priority on hold.

I have heard so many of the memes and cliches the creatives are the worst when it comes to time management. It's not until the deadline is pressing up against us that we finally get into gear.

This year my theme is "Commit". Figuring out ways to better commit to the things I've said yes to and to things I've been wanting to do. With my work projects. Learning how to make and cultivate better personal and professional relationships. But not only commit but to do them well. I find that I have a tendency to commit but only do least.

Since it's easier to move the needle of my habits with small changes other than go full crazy. One idea I have is to bump up the deadlines to all my projects internally on in my personal calendar by a few days. Since I know I get in gear when the deadline is looming closer. The hope is that this will give me the time needed to finesse my projects after the new deadline. And will give me buffer. Or it might not help at all.

Most of the goal is to not have the amount of pressing deadline urgency pile up to the point when it's crippling. Where the mountain of tasks to do is so big I don't event know where to start. How to get out of the hole I've dug my self into. Maybe if I can stay a head of the mountain, when the rapids come I can learn to find joy in them instead of drowning.
