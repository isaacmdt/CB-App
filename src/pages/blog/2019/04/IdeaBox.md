Finally getting some breathing room to get few things done on the [to-do list](https://trello.com/b/V18qg8Ei/creative-box-road-map).

I'm glad to say that the idea box is now open. If you have any CreativeBox Daily word ideas send them over.

If you have any other feature ideas for the web app tho you can send those over email to hellocreativebox@gmail.com (I know, I know. Getting a real email is also on the list.)

Can't wait to hear what ideas you might have.
