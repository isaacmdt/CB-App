Welcome to the CreativeBox blog. Weekly posts of different ways to use the Creative Box App. As well as community highlights. Of how others are using CBx to write, design, paint, draw, and other countless creative ways.

Fifty-Two. Fifty-two is my commitment in 2019. I am the worst with long term goals so Fifty two post, once a week. I can do a weekly post. Right?! I also am planning on doing some video content as posts since that is one of my creative boxes. (#mycreativebox)

Here's the thing. I don't expect CBx to go big. This is a personal passion project for me. To push myself to get past being a good creative and being the one of the best. If along the way CBx picks up momentum then that's awesome.

I am glad you're here! Together we can work on our building creative muscles. To be better than we were yesterday. Better in each of our own creative boxes whatever they may be. And look I've already done my first public progressive web app with a blog.

My name is Isaac and welcome to CreativeBox community.
